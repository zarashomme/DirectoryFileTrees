In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

When debugging, we ran into the issue of getting "segmentation fault (core dumped)" 
errors in our code, resulting in the code not running. We prompted ChatGPT to 
identify what the issue may be in our error commands, and it responded 
that fprintf cannot pass failed arguements. However, we still wanted to 
maintain specificityin our error messages, so we changed our 
code to account for these cases. 

Furthermore, we ran into a memory valgrind issue, and I inputted the code
portion of FT_traversePath, prompting it to identify where we may be failing to 
free memory. It alerted us to areas where we didn't free oPPrefix, and 
we changed the code accordingly. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I found the assignment to be helpful in handling larger projects. 
The bulk of my time was spent actually comprehending what each 
portion of the code did and how each module interconnected to one another. 
Thus, it was helpful in learning not just to code, but what/where to 
expand on a preexisting work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None for the checkerDT itself. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

Disregarding the exceptions specified in the assignment(loops, etc. ), 
the remaining warning is: 
" checkerDT.c: line 14: low priority:
   This function definition probably needs more local comments" 
We disagree with this warning because a comment was included for each
check/invariant, thus providing clear functionality for each part of the 
assignment checker. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

      
Disregarding the exceptions specified in the assignment(loops, etc. ), 
the remaining warnings are: 

nodeFT.c: (in function Node_free)
nodeFT.c:193:60: Variable ulIndex used before definition
An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some 
executionpath. 

I disagree with this warning since the description of bsearch specifies 
that ulIndex will always be provided a value/definition ( If the element is
not found, then assign the index where it would belong to *puIndex ). 
Thus, there should be no issue on this front .

ft.c: (in function FT_traversePath)
ft.c:110:42: Variable ulChildID used before definition. 

This is a similar situation as before. I disagree with this 
warning since the description of Node_hasChild specifies that ulChildID will 
always be provided a value/definition (If oNParent does not have
such a child, stores in *pulChildID the identifier that such a
child would have if inserted.)

nodeFT.h:76:5: Function exported but not used outside nodeFT: Node_compare
nodeFT.c:268:1: Definition of Node_compare

I disagree with this warning since I was following the 
original DT implementation has the same specification of the header file 
specifying Node_compare but it not actually being employed in other 
c files Thus, I maintained this style and didn't convert the function
to a static one. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."


Disregarding the exceptions specified in the assignment(loops, etc. ), 
the remaining warnings are: 

ft.c: line 338: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
ft.c: line 514: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
nodeFT.c: line 62: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
nodeFT.c: line 302: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

I disagree with these validation warnings since the header file 
specifies that is legal for the contents of a file Node to be NULL. 
("Note: contents may be NULL.").


------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.

      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1        BDT_insert() - does not include an initialization 
                        check, resulting in an error when attempting to 
                        insert into a unitialized tree. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2        BDT_rm() - When attempting to remove a node 
                          subtree, this implementation mistakenly 
                          eliminates the sibling nodes as well. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3        BDT_insert() - Incorrectly nests the nodes
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4        BDT_toString() - When attempting to access 
                          the array of nodes, the implementation fails to 
                          free the elements within it, creating 
                          improper references. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5        BDT_rm() - Another memory freeing issue,
                          resulting in inconsistencies 
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
check 2.5 for what type of critiques they are looking for 

In DT_rmDir, the function fails to assert whether the DT is 
initialized or not, which it should be since one cannot remove 
a directory from an unitialized tree. However, this will 
be handled by the checker we implemented. 

In DT_toString, the mapping function called is DT_strcatAccumulate, 
which scans the entire string (n) runtime and can become increasingly
inefficient when needing to perform the string operation on several 
nodes, which is the case in the client tester. Having a pointer 
to the end of when the function was last called can prevent this
rescanning of the string and improve efficiency. 

Although I disagreed with the splint nodeFT Node_compare function earlier
since I followed this stylistic choice, I do think this is still a critique.
The Node_compare function is not used by any external functions and thus 
can be labeled as static, with the description contained 
within the nodeDTGood.c file.
